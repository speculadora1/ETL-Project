# ETL-Project

For our ETL project we choose to explore rather the male/female ratio of a state had any bearing on drinking prevalence and vehicular fatalities.

Extract:

We pulled data crash data from the NHTSA, demographic data from the Kaiser Foundation, and drinking data from the CDC.  After the data was all pulled it was uploaded into pandas for cleanup and assimilation.

Transform:

Unneccessary columns were removed and the data was merged into a single data set.

Load:

Created schema and uploaded to a SQL database.  To ensure it loaded correctly database was queried.
